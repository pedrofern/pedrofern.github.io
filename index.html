                            <br/>Laboratory / Project V (LAPR5) – 20 values</h6>
                        <p>

                            • The LAPR5 project had the objective of developing the architecture and implementation of a pharmacy management.
                            <br/> • The project contemplated components for administering drugs, prescriptions, stock of pharmacies,
                            orders and their monitoring.
                            <br/> • As a basis, we had the Medication and Receipt APIs, performed during the semester in the discipline
                            of ARQSI (Systems Architecture).
                            <br/> • In the end, 4 Back-End were made in Node.js (Express and Sails), 3 Front-End (Angular JS and
                            React), centralized information with Auth0, MongoDB databases, two Linux servers (Monitoring
                            and Parser Prolog) and an API in Node.js for bootstrap.
                            <br/> • The group was formed by 7 people. Each one had several contributions and in the different
                            areas.
                            <br/> • I collaborated, fundamentally, in the Back-end component of pharmacy management, issues related
                            to the adaptability of the GDRP (General Data Protection Regulation) to the whole system and
                            implemented the monitoring system.
                            <br/> • The monitoring system covered 100% of the components. As a complement to this area, implemented
                            daily backups of all databases.
                            <br/> • The project had a duration of 4 weeks in an intensive format and an agile and iterative with
                            four sprints.
                            <br/> • Continuous integration was used in git repositories. Each component had a repository.
                            <br/> • The documentation was in the general system repository wiki on Bitbucket.
                            <br/> • The management of the project was done using the AGILE methodology and through the Trello
                            platform.
                            <br/> • The project included a final presentation and demonstration of the whole system.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            <br/>Laboratory / Project IV (LAPR2) - 18 values</h6>
                        <p>
                            • The LAPR4 project aimed to add functionality to a spreadsheet, provided by the teachers, which served as the basis.
                            <br/> • The group was formed by the whole group, divided into 3 groups of 7 people.
                            <br/> • Each group was responsible for a different functional area (LANG, IPC and CORE) in each sprint.
                            <br/> • Each member of the group had to implement a new feature each week (1 in each area).
                            <br/> • The project lasted 3 weeks in an intensive format and an agile and iterative approach with
                            three sprints was used.
                            <br/> • Continuous integration was used in a single branch git repository, JUnit, Gradle, Jenkis and
                            SonarQube.
                            <br/> • The data was stored in a database.
                            <br/> • The documentation was on the Bitbucket wiki.
                            <br/> • The management of the project was done using the SCRUM methodology and through the JIRA platform.
                            <br/> • The project included one presentation per group, in each sprint, and one individual final
                            presentation.

                        <p>
                            • The LAPR3 project aimed to implement a Java solution to calculate the consumption of commercial jet aircraft, using an
                            approximate physical model, and calculating routes with different objectives (lower consumption,
                            faster, etc.).
